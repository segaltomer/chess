# How this project works

A running explanation, written as the project is built — one entry per piece of
work, added at the time it is written, not reconstructed at the end.

**Purpose:** I have to be able to explain this project out loud. This file is
what I revise from. So entries are short, in plain language, and say *why* as
well as *what*. If an entry needs a diagram to make sense, it gets one.

**Format for each entry:**

```
## <what was built>  ·  <files>  ·  <requirement refs>

What it does — two or three sentences, plain language.

Why it is built this way — the alternative that was rejected and why.

The tricky part — the one thing that was not obvious, or that broke first.

## Project setup · toolchain, ProvidedGUI, folder layout · §85-89

The project compiles with `g++` from MSYS2 UCRT64 (g++ 16.2.0, SFML 3.0.2),
because §85-89 require it and the lecturer's own `build_example.bat` hardcodes
that path. Visual Studio would mean MSVC, a different compiler whose linker
cannot read the MinGW SFML libraries installed by pacman.

`ProvidedGUI/` is the lecturer's GUI component, unmodified and submitted as-is.
It only draws and reports clicks — it does not know chess rules, does not
validate moves and does not do networking (§2). Our code tells it what to show
via `setBoard`, `setTurnText`, `setStatusText`, and receives user intent back
from `pollEvent`.

Code is split three ways: `common/` for the chess rules and protocol messages,
`client/` for screens and GUI wiring, `server/` for hosting online games. The
rules are in `common/` because they compile into *both* programs — the Client
validates Local and Bot games (§17-18) while the Server validates Online ones
(§22), and §6 requires those to be the same rules.

**The tricky part:** the executables need 18 SFML and MinGW DLLs at runtime.
Windows only looks next to the executable and on `PATH`, so the DLLs are copied
into the project folder — and they must ship in the submission zip, because the
grading machine will not have our `PATH`.
